OpenAI Fine Tuned Model for Carbon-foote

Use Cases:
- The module should rely on a platform-embedded chatbot to help citizens, field operators and logistics staff understand the platform and act upon any given problems.
  For instance, the chatbot should be able to explain in detail, to a field operator, how to perform a device maintenance or guide a citizen through the steps of joining an existing campaign.
  The chatbot should be tailored to the platform (Carbon-Foote)
